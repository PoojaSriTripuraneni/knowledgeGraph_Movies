# Use Case

## Narrative

The rise of streaming platforms and the evolving entertainment industry have created a need for more advanced analytical tools to understand movie performance, audience preferences and industry trends. A knowledge graph can serve as a powerful tool to explore these dynamics by connecting data points such as actors, directors, budgets, gross earnings and audience ratings across various datasets. For instance, understanding which actors consistently work with specific directors and how those collaborations impact movie ratings can offer insights for both content creators and marketers. Such relationships are valuable when determining the bset talent combinations for future for future projects.

Additionally, analyzing the correlation between a movie's budget and its gross earnings over different decades provides vital financial insights for studios and producers. This allows them to identify trends in financial performance and adjust budget allocations to maximize profitability. The ability to identify the highest-grossing production companies also supports studios in benchmarking against competitors and assessing which production strategies are most successful.
